*AI GENERATED PLACEHOLDER POETRY*

Lines etched in air, a whispered rhyme,
Awaiting meaning, waiting for its time.
A canvas bare, a melody unheard,
A placeholder for a waiting word.

The heart's a vessel, brimming with desire,
But the perfect code still sits on the pyre.
A sculptor's dream, a silhouette in clay,
A promise of beauty, waiting for the day.

The inkwell sleeps, the brush poised in hand,
Aching to capture what the soul commands.
But patience holds, a silent, steady drum,
For the perfect HTML will surely come.
