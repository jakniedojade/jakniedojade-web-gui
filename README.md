# Frontend of jakniedojade app

Run `npm run start` for a dev server and licences file update. If not set otherwise, it will run on `http://localhost:4200/`. 
Remember to run `npm i` before!
Do not use `ng serve`, as it won't update licences file!

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
